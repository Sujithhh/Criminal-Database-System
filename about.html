    <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
    <br>
    
    <p class="op1">It is well understood that crime prevention, detection and conviction of criminals depend on a
highly responsive backbone of information management. So the efficiency of police department in tackling
crimes depend on what quality of information it can derive from its existing records and how fast it can have
access to it.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p class="op1">criminal database management system is useful in storing and maintaining the information
about the crimes happening in the state. The principle point of this venture is to allow the police officers and
other government authorities of crime bureau to enter the arrival of any law breaks, along with the crime he
has done. It also includes the information about the punishments and judgements provided for the crime. The
system is implemented in such a way that, the government authorities and officials belonging to the prime
department login to the system and can have access of the database. As they can access information across
all the crime records in the state, thus helping speedy and successful completion to the case. The information
is stored in the form of tables specifically designed using MySQL. And we can manipulate the stored
information i.e., storing, retrieval and updating. We believe this will help in saving up the store facilities,
saving time and other resources.
